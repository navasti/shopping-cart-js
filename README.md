# Shopping cart

The premise was to create a simple shopping cart page based on Vanilla JavaScript. The page is responsive but not intended for mobile.
This is a simple store page with an efficient shopping cart. Technologies I used when creating the project are: HTML, CSS(SCSS), Git, JavaSctipt, FontAwesome Icons. I used free pictures downloaded from pexels.com and pixabay.com.

### Me

This is my first project which I created and made publicly available. So it may be far from perfect but it works and looks good :)
